This project explores data about Netflix shows and movies using Python for data analysis and visualization, with the option to integrate visualizations into R.

Instructions:

Download the Netflix_shows_movies.csv file: Make sure this file is in the same directory as your Python script.

Run the Python script:

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the Python script and Netflix_shows_movies.csv.
Run the script using python script_name.py (replace script_name.py with the actual filename).
The script will:

Load the data from the CSV file.
Print information about the dataset.
Check for missing values.
Handle missing values by dropping rows 
Generate descriptive statistics for the cleaned data.
Create two visualizations:
Most Watched Genres: A bar chart showing the frequency of each genre.
Distribution of Ratings: A histogram with a density curve showing the distribution of ratings.
Save these visualizations as PNG images in the specified directory (C:\\Users\\Admin\\Desktop\\Module4Work).
Integrate the Visualization into R (Optional):

Open R Studio or your preferred R environment.
Ensure you have installed the required R libraries (ggplot2, png, and grid).
Copy and paste the R code provided at the end of this document.
Set the setwd command to point to the directory containing the generated PNG image (replace C:/Users/Admin/Desktop/Module4Work with your actual directory).
Run the R code.
The R code will load the saved PNG image and display it within R.
